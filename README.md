![Iris Flowers](iris.jpg)

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for an Iris Flower Classification project. The project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into different species based on their petal and sepal characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset, which is available in the scikit-learn library. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Project Structure

- **data:** Contains the dataset files.
- **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **src:** Source code for data processing, model architecture, and evaluation.
- **models:** Saved model checkpoints.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists required Python libraries.
- **README.md:** You are reading this file right now!
- **LICENSE:** The project's license information.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flower-classification.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd iris-flower-classification`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to understand the project's workflow.
